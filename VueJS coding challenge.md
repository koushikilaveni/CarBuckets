# VueJS Coding Challenge

## CarBuckets Technical Challenge

For this coding challenge, you will find a project created with the Vue CLI. This project contains a basic web-app with a single view, some components, some methods, and a mock API.

This single view was extracted from our web-app and is code that you will probably be working on as one of our front-end engineers in your day-to-day at CarBuckets! The primary purpose of this view is to apply discount value to vehicles.

### Objectives

We want candidates to review the project and accomplish any of the following:

- Add a feature
- Remove a feature
- Modify a feature
- Fix a bug

****Try to do 3 out of the 4 tasks.***

### Relevant Notes

- You must start both services locally to get the project running, naturally. Check the package.json scripts for the available options and/or the repo README.
- The mock API will not save/update the table's values, don't worry about this!
- We will require that you turn in the "completed" source code and a changelog with your code changes in a Zip file.

> Good luck!
